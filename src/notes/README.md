<h1 align="center">🛡️ Notes</h1>

This section is my **technical notebook** — a living collection of what I learn, test, and refine across cybersecurity, system administration, and software engineering.

---

I use these notes to:

- Consolidate fragmented knowledge from CTFs, labs, and courses.  
- Record useful commands, configurations, and short explanations.  
- Bridge concepts between offensive, defensive, and operational security.
